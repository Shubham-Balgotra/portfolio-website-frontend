          a self-taught MERN Stack Developer with a background in technical

          <span className="font-medium">years of experience</span> in the

          My journey into web development began from a desire to{" "}
          <span className="italic">create</span> and not just troubleshoot.
          Since then, I've built and deployed production-grade full-stack
          applications — from a modern e-commerce platform to a real-time news
          aggregator — using{" "}

        <p className=" text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I’m passionate about problem-solving, clean code, and building
          user-focused products. Whether I'm designing a feature or debugging an
          issue, I thrive in environments that value growth, collaboration, and
          innovation.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
  I’m now seeking opportunities where I can contribute to impactful
  projects, learn from talented teams, and grow into a more advanced
  developer — while delivering great user experiences along the way.
